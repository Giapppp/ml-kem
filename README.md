# ML-KEM
My implementation of FIPS-203: Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Standard in Rust. Notice that this is a personal project created for learning purposes, so it mustn't be used in real world application.

## Resources
1. [FIPS 203: Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final)

2. [Vadim Lyubashevsky, Basic Lattice Cryptography: The concepts behind Kyber (ML-KEM) and Dilithium (ML-DSA)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1287.pdf)

## To-do list

- [ ] Clean code.

- [ ] Make the code run faster.

- [ ] Have more testcases

I think this repository still can be better, so I will very happy if you have any ideas to improve it!
